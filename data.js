    Unsupervised learning algorithmic techniques are applied in grouping the data depending upon similar attributes, most similar patterns, or relationships amongst the dataset points or values. These Machine learning models are also referred to as self-organizing models which operate on clustering technique. Distinct approaches are employed on every other algorithm in splitting up data into clusters. Unsupervised machine learning uncovers previously unknown patterns in data.

        `
        This study investigates the use of autoencoders for reconstructing noised images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset. By introducing noise to simulate real-world distortions, we evaluate both shallow and deep autoencoder architectures for image denoising. Performance is assessed using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). Results indicate that deep autoencoders outperform shallow ones, achieving better reconstructions with lower error rates. The research underscores the effectiveness of autoencoders in enhancing image quality under noisy conditions, providing valuable insights for practical applications in the fashion domain.`,
