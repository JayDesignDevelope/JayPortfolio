    Unsupervised learning algorithmic techniques are applied in grouping the data depending upon similar attributes, most similar patterns, or relationships amongst the dataset points or values. These Machine learning models are also referred to as self-organizing models which operate on clustering technique. Distinct approaches are employed on every other algorithm in splitting up data into clusters. Unsupervised machine learning uncovers previously unknown patterns in data.
